Architecture
A brief overview of system architecture
Components
Binalyze AIR is an on-premise client-server solution that allows you to remotely perform a variety of tasks on endpoints such as collecting forensic evidence and performing triage with YARA. 
1. Management Console
Management Console is a web-based application that can be viewed from any device with an up-to-date browser.
2. Endpoint Agents
Endpoints connect to the management console via a light-weight "passive" agent that can be deployed manually or via mechanisms such as SCCM. 
2.1. Passive Agent Explained
As you might have already guessed from the term "passive agent", AIR agents:
DO NOT scan anything on the endpoint which may cause slowdowns (e.g. your Antivirus),
DO NOT block anything on the endpoint which may cause false-positives (e.g. your DLP),
DO NOT create any alerts which may cause "alert-fatigue".
